# Review of heavy-tail extensions

This repository is to share codes used in our paper titled “An Overview
of Heavy-Tail Extensions of Multivariate Gaussian Distribution and Their
Relations”, [available in Journal of Applied Statistics](url) (currently
under revision).

Two R scripts (with “.R” extension) are given here, each of which is to
reproduce each subsection in Section 4. First, in `code_sec_4.1.R`, we
illustrate visual differences of the heavy-tail extensions by bivariate
scatter plots. Next, in `code_sec_4.2.R`, we analyze different scatter
matrix estimators based on the microarray data. More details can be
found in our manuscript.
